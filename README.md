# Decision Tree Sample

### A Short Summary

A decision tree starts at a single point (or ‘node’) which then branches (or ‘splits’) in two or more directions. Each branch offers different possible outcomes, incorporating a variety of decisions and chance events until a final outcome is achieved.

## Summary Of The My Sample
In my sample, I would like to forecast how car's age could influence car's price.End of the project I wanted to compare Decision Tree graph with Linear and Polynomial Regression graph to see and have much more comprehension of Regression Models.
